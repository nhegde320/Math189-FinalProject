In this study, exploratory data analysis was performed in-depth on historical and current NCAA data to see if there were any anomalies or trends between performance and location. This was followed by hypothesis testings to check if any differences were statistically significant. Finally, a tree model was built to see if the feature ​location​ was even among the top features used to predict the outcomes.
